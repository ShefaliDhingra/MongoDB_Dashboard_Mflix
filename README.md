# Movie Trends Dashboard in MongoDB

## Overview
This project leverages the **MFlix dataset** and MongoDB to analyze global movie trends, including release patterns, genre popularity, audience ratings, and award performance.  
An interactive dashboard (see below) visualizes insights for strategic decision-making in the movie industry.
